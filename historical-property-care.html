What is the difference between interior and exterior painting services in Glendale, AZ? <br>  While both types of painting services involve the application of paint to surfaces, there are some key differences between the two. Interior painting services typically involve painting the walls, ceilings, and trim inside a home or commercial building. <br>  Interior painters may use different techniques and tools than exterior painters, as they need to work in tight spaces and around furniture and other obstacles. On the other hand, exterior painting services focus on painting the outside of a building or structure. Historical Property Care  <br>  Exterior painters may need to use specialized equipment such as scaffolding or ladders to reach high areas, as well as durable paints that can withstand sun exposure and moisture. In addition to these practical differences, there are also aesthetic considerations that differentiate interior and exterior painting services. <br></p></div>
